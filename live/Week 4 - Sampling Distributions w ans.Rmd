This week we will learn how to compute probabilities of the sample mean, using the sampling distribution. 

Let's first use the R console as a calculator to compute total possible samples for theoretical sampling and then for experimental sampling.

How many samples of four participants (n = 4) from a population of ten people (N = 10) would we have using THEORETICAL sampling?

How many samples of four participants (n = 4) from a population of ten people (N = 10) would we have using EXPERIMENTAL sampling? (Use `n! = factorial(n)` for this formula) $$\frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}$$

### Sampling Distribution of the Mean

Returning to the IQ score example: IQ tests are scored to have a population mean of 100 and standard deviation 15, and approximately normally distributed. Last week, we found the probability that an individual scores greater than 120 using two equivalent methods:
```{r}
#Method 1 - using the z-score in pnorm
(120-100)/15 #this finds the z-score
pnorm(1.3333333, lower.tail=FALSE)

#Method 2 - using the raw score in pnorm
pnorm(120, mean=100, sd=15, lower.tail=FALSE)
```

This week, we're going to work with the sampling distribution of the **mean**. In other words, instead of considering the probability value for an individual, we want to find the probability that the mean of a sample group is above or below a given value. 

**Central Limit Theorem** - the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal, given the population is normally distributed OR the sample size is sufficiently large (i.e. > 30). Additionally,
$$\mu_M = \mu \text{ and} \\  \sigma_M \text{ or } SEM = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
This enables us to compute the probability for the mean of a sample of individuals from a given population. For example, what is the probability that a sample of 9 individuals has a mean IQ greater than 110 on an IQ test?
 - First, we need to compute the standard error (se), as this will replace the standard deviation in our sampling distribution calculations. (Use the console to find se.)
 - Next, using either Method 1 or Method 2 above, find the probability using the CLT.

```{r}
#the code for the probability calculation:
pnorm(110, mean=100, sd=5, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
There is a 2.28% chance of selecting a random group of 9 people with an average IQ above 110.

Now try the following questions out with different population values:

IQ tests are normed to have a mean of 140 and standard deviation of 12. What is the probability that a sample of 5 individuals has a mean less than 130 on an IQ test?

```{r}
#Type the code for the probability calculation here:
pnorm(130, mean=140, sd=12/sqrt(5), lower.tail = TRUE)
```
There is a 3.12% chance of selecting a random group of 5 people from this population with mean IQ below 130.

What's the probability that a sample of 10 has a mean greater than 150 on the same IQ test?
```{r}
#Type the code for the probability calculation here:
pnorm(150, mean=140, sd=12/sqrt(10), lower.tail = FALSE)
```
There is a 0.42% chance of selecting a random group of 10 people from this population with mean IQ above 150.

Now suppose we have state standardized math test, with mean of 170 and an sd of 15. 

What is the probability that a sample of 7 students has a mean greater than 175?
```{r}
#Type the code for the probability calculation here:
pnorm(175, mean=170, sd=15/sqrt(7), lower.tail = FALSE)
```
(What did we need to assume to complete this calculation?)
To use the CLT, we assumed the math test scores have a normal distribution, since the sample size is less than 30.
