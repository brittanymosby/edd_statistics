# LLO Applied Stats, Summer 2021

This is a supplementary page for Professor Mosby's section of LLO 8180 - Applied Statistics. Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for live sessions and assignments. 

## Live Session RStudio (.Rmd) Files
These are the RStudio files and data files that we will use for our live session meetings each week. While you don't have to run the code in advance of class, some of you might prefer to do so. I will upload all code at least 24 hours before our class meetings.
- Week 1 - [Introduction Rmd File](./live/Week 1_Introduction to R.Rmd)
- Week 2 - [Summary Statistics Rmd File](./live/Week 2_Summary Statistics.Rmd), [Data file](./live/week2data.txt) 
- Week 3 - [Normal Probability and Z-Scores](./live/Week 3 - Normal Prob and Z-Scores.Rmd)
- Week 4 - [Sampling Strategy](./live/Week 4 - Sampling Distributions.Rmd)


## Assignments
Each assignment is worth 100 points. Assignments should be uploaded to the LMS (2VU) before 7PM (CT) on their given due date. Submissions should include two files:
1. Your .Rmd code file
2. Your "knitted" assignment file. The knit file can be an html, word, or pdf document (you only need to choose one, you do not need to submit it in multiple formats). 

| File      | Due Date          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Assignment 1 Rmd file](./assignments/Assignment 1.Rmd), [Assignment 1 data file](./assignments/phd.txt) | Thursday 5/27 |
