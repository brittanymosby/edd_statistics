# Week 7 - Two Way ANOVA

A main effect is a source of variation associated with mean differences:
- In the cell means given in a table summary
- Across the combination of levels of two factors
- Across the levels of a single factor
- Across the combination of levels of two or more factors
---
A researcher conducts a study in which 12 participants are observed at each combination of two factors, where Factor A has three levels and Factor B has two levels. What are the degrees of freedom for error?
- 6
- 66
- 71
- 72
---
Simple main effect tests are necessary to analyze
- A significant main effect
- Any significant effect
- A significant interaction
- The results of a one-way ANOVA
---
A researcher reports the following interaction: F(2, 44) = 3.11. Is the p-value less than .05 for this test?
- Yes, because the 3.11 is larger than the critical value
- No, because 3.11 is smaller than the critical value
- No, because 3.11 is larger than the critical value
- Not enough information
---
Using a two-way between-subjects ANOVA, Factor A has four levels, Factor B has three levels, and n = 6. If SS_A = 300 and SS_E = 180, then what was the decision for the main effect of Factor A at a .05 level of significance?
- Reject the null hypothesis
- Fail to reject the null hypothesis
- Not enough information
