# Week 9 - One-Way ANOVA

The one-way between-subjects ANOVA is used when different participants are assigned to _____ group(s).
- one
- two
- two or more
- zero
---
The source of variation that cannot be attributed to or caused by having different groups is called:
- Within-groups variation
- Error variation
- Between-groups variation
- None of these
---
What is the between-groups degrees of freedom for a study with n = 12 in each of four groups?
- 3
- 4
- 32
- 36
---
What is the within-groups degrees of freedom for a study with n = 10 in each of three groups?
- 2
- 7
- 27
- 30

---
Homogeneity of variance refers to the assumption that:
- Data in the population or populations being sampled from are normally distributed
- The variance of scores in each population is equal
- The probabilities of each measured outcome in a study are independent
- The data were selected using a random sampling procedure

---
A researcher randomly assigned 33 adults to engage in a conversation with someone dressed in causal, informal, or formal clothes. The duration of eye contact (in seconds) was recorded. If the SSbetween = 30 and SSwithin = 104, then set up the ANOVA table and make a decision at a .05 level of significance.
- Fail to reject the null hypothesis
- Reject the null hypothesis
