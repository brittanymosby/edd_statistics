# Week 4 - Sampling Distributions

A distribution of all possible sample means that could be obtained in samples of a given size from the same population is called a:
- normal distribution
- *sampling distribution*
- binomial distribution 
- skewed distribution

The standard error of the mean is (select all apply):
- *The standard deviation for a sampling distribution*
- Equal to the mean divided by the square root of the sample size
- *A measure of the distance that sample means deviate from the population mean over repeated sampling*

A researcher selects a sample of 25 participants from a population with a standard deviation equal to 5. What is the standard error of the mean for the sampling distribution?
- 0.2
- ***1***
- 5
- 25

Researcher A selects a sample of 20 participates. Research B selects a sample of 30 participants. If both samples were selected from the same population, then which researcher selected a sample associated with a larger standard error?
- *Researcher A*
- Researcher B
- Impossible to determine with the information given 

A researcher selects a sample of 25 participants from a population with a mean of 20 and a standard deviation of 10. What is the range of values for the sample mean that fall within 1 standard error of the mean in a sampling distribution?
- 16 to 24
- 21 to 29
- ***18 to 22***
- 18.5 to 21.5

A researcher selects a sample of nine participants from a population with a mean equal to 10 and a standard deviation equal to 3. What is the z-score for selecting a sample mean equal to 7.0 from this population?
- +3.00
- ***-3.00***
- +1.00
- -1.00

A researcher selects a sample of nine participants from a population with a mean equal to 10 and a standard deviation equal to 3. What is the probability of selecting a sample mean of 7.0 or less from this population?
- ***.0013***
- .4987
- .9987
- 1.00
