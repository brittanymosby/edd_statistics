# Week 7 - Two Sample t-Tests

A researcher finds a mean difference of 1.0 between two sample means. If the pooled sample variance is 4.0, then what is the Cohenâ€™s d?
- .25
- .50
- 1.40
- 2.0

A researcher observes the same group of participants in the morning and again at night. What type of research design did the researcher use?
- Repeated-measures design
- Matched-pairs design
---
A researcher compares differences in personality traits among pairs of identical twins. What type of research design did the researcher use?
- Repeated-measures design
- Matched-pairs design

Difference scores are computed ________ we compute the test statistic for the related-samples t test.
- Before
- After
---
A group of 20 participants is observed two times. The related-samples t test for this study will have a degree(s) of freedom equal to:
- 1
- 18
- 19
- 20
---
A researcher measures scores in two groups (n = 12 in each group) with a mean difference of 5. In this study, the estimated standard error for difference scores is 2.9. What is the decision for a related-samples t test using a two-tailed test, alpha .05? 
- Reject the null hypothesis
- Fail to reject the null hypothesis
- Not enough information to determine

A researcher computes the following test statistic for a related-samples t test: t(22) = 3.14, p < .05. What is the proportion of variance explained using the formula for eta-squared?
- .21
- .27
- .24
- .31
