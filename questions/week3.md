# Week 3 - Normal Probability and Z-scores

Values for probability can be
- *between 0 and 1*
- between -1 and +1
- any positive value
- any positive or negative value

Suppose the probability that someone is texting and getting in a car crash is 0.1. Also suppose the probability that someone is texting while driving is 0.2. What's the conditional probability of someone getting into a car crash, given they were texting?
- 0.1
- 0.2
- 0.5
- 2.0

A normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 is called a:
- small normal distribution
- minimal normal distribution
- *standard normal distribution*
- centered normal distribution 

A normal distribution has a mean of 10 and a variance of 4. What is the z-score for x = 13?
- 0.75
- ***1.5***
- 3.0
- 13.0
