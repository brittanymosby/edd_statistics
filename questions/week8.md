# Week 8 - Confidence Intervals

In hypothesis testing, a decision is made to reject the null hypothesis when
- The null hypothesis value is contained within the confidence interval
- The null hypothesis value is outside of the confidence interval

A sample of scores is normally distributed with M = 12 and population standard error = 5. What is the 95% confidence interval for a one-sample z test?
- [7.0, 17.0]
- [3.8, 20.2]
- [2.2, 21.8]
- [10.0, 14.0]

A sample of 20 scores is normally distributed with M = 10 and s = 2. What is the 95% confidence interval for a one-sample t-test?
- [6.5, 13.5]
- [9.1, 10.9]
- [8.0, 12.0]
- [5.8 14.2]

A researcher selects a sample and assigns participants to one of two groups. Score in each group are normally distributed with M_1 = 35 (n_1 = 10), M_2 = 23 (n_2 = 10) and a pooled standard error of 1.8. What is the 95% confidence interval for an independent samples t-test?
- [6.2, 13.8]
- [8.2, 15.8]
- [10.2, 13.8]
- [23.0, 35.0]

A sample of 16 difference scores is normally distributed with a mean of 14.8 and standard deviation of 3. What is the 95% confidence interval for a related-samples t-test?
- [11.8, 17.8]
- [13.2, 16.4]
- [8.4, 21.2]
- [9.6, 21.0]
